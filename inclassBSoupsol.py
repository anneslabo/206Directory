# first, get the thing that contains them all, the span!
span_container = soup.find("span") # there's only one
print(span_container) # check it out
paragraph_tags = span_container.find_all("p") # they're all in p tags, and span_container is itself a BSoup object!
print(paragraph_tags) # check it out
print("\n")
for pt in paragraph_tags:
	print(pt.text) # and if you want to cut out the extra space, .strip().rstrip()
	# e.g.
	# print(pt.text.strip().rstrip())
